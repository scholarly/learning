presentation of selected topics covered in [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)

This presentation consists of the following files:

 * [audio recording](https://github.com/scholarly/learning/blob/master/final.ogg)
 * [script for audio recording](https://github.com/scholarly/learning/blob/master/final.txt)
 * [slides for presentation](https://github.com/scholarly/learning/blob/master/slides%20for%20final.pdf)

The decision to not include citations was "There isn't time". That is not a good reason, but it is what it is.  I had a very different presentation in mind that would have taken more time than I had available. Perhaps I will publish a more polished and interesting video in the future.
