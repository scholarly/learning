presentation of selected topics covered in [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)


I propose to prepare and give a presentation of the key topics of the course for my daughter's fifth grade (USA) class.  I will share how my learning techniques have improved due to this course and strongly encourage each of the students to take the class when it next becomes available. (This presentation will also meet the criteria for one of the six requirements I need to finish my B.S.) I will record the presentation and post the video on Vimeo.

Key topics:
 * Importance of independent learning: you are responsible for your own learning.
 * Seek to understand deeply the things you choose to learn. Don't learn "just enough to get by."  Many of the specific study techniques discussed in this course support this goal. (e.g. diffuse/focused modes, spaced repetition, flash cards, periodic stretch breaks)
 * Take care of yourself physically: exercise, eat well, and get enough quality sleep.
 * Consider using the Pomodoro Technique to combat procrastination.
